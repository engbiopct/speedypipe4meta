Building DAG of jobs...
Your conda installation is not configured to use strict channel priorities. This is however crucial for having robust and correct environments (for details, see https://conda-forge.org/docs/user/tipsandtricks.html). Please consider to configure strict priorities by executing 'conda config --set channel_priority strict'.
Using shell: /bin/bash

Rules claiming more threads will be scaled down.

Error in rule prokka_bin:

    output: results/M1/prokka_bin
    log: results/M1/prokka_bin/log-stdout.txt, results/M1/prokka_bin/log-stderr.txt (check log file(s) for error details)

        (one of the commands exited with non-zero exit code; note that snakemake uses bash strict mode!)

Removing output files of failed job prokka_bin since they might be corrupted:
results/M1/prokka_bin
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
