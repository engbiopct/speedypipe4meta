MissingOutputException in rule maxbin2 in file /storage1/victor/speedypipe4meta/Snakefile, line 228:
Job 9  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
results/M1/maxbin/maxbin.marker
Removing output files of failed job maxbin2 since they might be corrupted:
results/M1/maxbin
Terminating processes on user request, this might take some time.
Cancelling snakemake on user request.
