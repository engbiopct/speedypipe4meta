Building DAG of jobs...
Your conda installation is not configured to use strict channel priorities. This is however crucial for having robust and correct environments (for details, see https://conda-forge.org/docs/user/tipsandtricks.html). Please consider to configure strict priorities by executing 'conda config --set channel_priority strict'.

MissingOutputException in rule pileup_install in file /storage1/victor/speedypipe4meta/Snakefile, line 174:
Job 4  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
results/bin/bbmap/pileup.sh
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
